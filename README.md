**Task 1**
<br>
**Student Grade Calculator**
<br>
**Input:** Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
<br>
Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
<br>
Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the
average percentage.
<br>
Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
<br>
Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
<br>
**TASK 2**
<br>
**ATM INTERFACE**
<br>
1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
<br>
2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.
<br>
3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().
<br>
4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
<br>
5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.
<br>
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
<br>
7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
of their transactions.
<br>
**TASK 3**
<br>
**STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
<br>
1.Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll
number, grade, and any other relevant details.
<br>
2.Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include
methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.
<br>
3 . Design the user interface for the Student Management System. This can be a console-based
interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
<br>
4. Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a
database.
<br>
5. Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all
students, and exiting the application.
<br>
6. Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student
data is in the correct format.
